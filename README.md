# Yet another SVG to G-code tool

As the name suggest this tool generates g-code for our xy-plotter directly from an SVG file with the following features:
* use a servo motor to handle the pen
* use simple non feeding motion g-codes
* support lines, circles, radis, filled shapes
* simple optimisation

> **DISCLAIMER**
> Beware that this is a specialized tool written for our xy-plotter. Feel free none the less to fork this repo and adopt it to your needs or try reaching out to us for support.
>
> Meaning this tool is not meant as a general purpose solution to generate g-code out of svg files.
